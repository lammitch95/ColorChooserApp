# ColorChooserApp

Part 2) ColorChooser App in chapter 13 of the Deitel and Deitel

Part 2-Challenge) The given ColorChooser App in Chapter 13, Section 13.4 of the Deitel and Deitel book, uses a (unidirectional) property binding to update a TextField's text when the Slider value changes, but not vice versa. JavaFX also supports bi-directional property bindings. Research about bi-directional property bindings online, then reimplement this app to create bidirectional bindings between the Sliders and the TextFields such that modifying a TextField's value updates the corresponding slider.
